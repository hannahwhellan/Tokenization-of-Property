# Tokenization-of-Property
A hackathon team project inspired by how blockchain can be used to lower the barriers of entry for investing in properties.
We used an open source algorithm to mine our blocks that store data such as transactions and increases or decrease 
of property values. We use a decentralized and verified ledger to keep track of tokens(representing equity) and 
fluctuations in property value. The broader idea was what if we created an app that allowed property owners to list 
their properties and tokenize them and for users (invesotrs) to buy tokens in these properties. However, properties can 
be fragmented as much as the owner wants to allow for more investors and tokens at a lower ticket price to get rid
of the barrier to investment. 

I worked on the Person class, the House class, the Property Chain class, and the Driver class.
